Hi! My name is Sarah Salter :). I am currently a Biostatistics graduate student at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.  I received my undergraduate training in Mathematical Science, and my graduate training in Biostatistics and Data Science. The past few years I have had the pleasure of working as a data scientist, medical research assistant and a teaching assistant during my time at Johns Hopkins University.

This blog is intended for data science enthusiasts, aspiring statistical ninjas, R-users, insatiable learners, and/or anyone that appreciates random pieces of information. I will share with you tools and insights into some of my experiences as a data scientist/statistician, as well as some of the interesting projects that I have worked on.

Learning is a beautiful experience. In my professional/educational journies I have come to realize that absorbing knowledge is always more fun when it is collaborative. For that reason, I was inspired to create this blog in hopes that by sharing my experiences I can help some people in their learning endeavors, while also learning from them in return. So please comment on any of my posts if you want to have further discussions! 

I am greatly looking forward to learning together! Thank you so much for checking out my blog!

P.S.- I encourage you to say hello on my Twitter account (linked on the homepage of this website). I will definitely share/re-post interesting findings/articiles to read on that forum.
