Hi! My name is Sarah Salter :). I am currently a Biostatistics graduate student at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.  I received my undergraduate training in Mathematical Science and Computer Science, and my graduate training in Biostatistics and Data Science. I have worked as a data scientist/medical research assistant and a teaching assistant during my time at JHU.

This blog is intended for data science enthusiasts, aspiring statistical ninjas, R-users, insatiable learners, and/or anyone that appreciates random pieces of information. I will share with you tools and insights into some of my experiences as a data scientist/statistician, as well as some of the interesting projects that I have worked on.

Learning is a beautiful experience. In my professional/educational journies I have come to realize that absorbing knowledge is always more fun when it is collaborative. For that reason, I was inspired to create this blog in hopes that by sharing my experiences, I can help some people in their learning endeavors, and hopefully learn from you as well. So please feel free to comment on any of my posts if you want to have further discussions-- it would be my pleasure! 

One of the most valuable pieces of wisdom I have ever learned is that only when a person acknowledges the gaps in their understanding (on a topic/subject manner) are they equipped gain the highest amount of knowledge and intuition (regarding the topic being studied). Although I am still actively learning in the fields that I have received training in, what I lack in experience I compensate for in my commitment to obtain the deepest amount of intuition in everything that I learn. With that being said, I am greatly looking forward to learning together! Thank you so much for checking out my blog!

P.S.- I encourage you to say hello on my Twitter account (linked on the homepage of this website). I will definitely share/re-post interesting finding/articiles to read on that forum.
