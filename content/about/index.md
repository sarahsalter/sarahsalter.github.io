Hi! My name is Sarah Salter :). I am currently a Biostatistics graduate student at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.  I received my undergraduate training in Mathematical Science and Computer Science, and my graduate training in Biostatistics and Data Science. 

This blog is intended for data science enthusiasts, aspiring statistical ninjas, R-users, insatiable learners, and/or anyone that appreciates random pieces of information. I will share with you tools and insights into some of my experiences as a data scientist/statistician, as well as some of the interesting projects that I have worked on.

One of the most valuable pieces of information I have ever learned, is that only when a person acknowledges the gaps in their understanding can they successfully gain the highest amount of intuition. Although I am still actively learning in the fields that I have received training in, what I lack in experience I compensate for in my commitment to obtain the deepest amount of intuition in everything that I learn. In my professional/educational journies I have come to realize that learning is always more fun when it is collaborative, so please feel free to comment on any of my posts if you want to have further discussions. 

I am greatly looking forward to learning together. Thank you so much for checking out my blog!

P.S.- I encourage you to say hello on my Twitter account (linked on the homepage of this website). I will definitely share/re-post interesting finding/articiles to read on that forum.
